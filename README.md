# eshop-database-system

## description
A database system for managing an e-shop with computer parts. I used PostgreSQL for the database and Hibernate ORM to map the tables to objects in Java. The database contains users, employees, products, orders, and other entities related to an e-shop.
I also created a simple DAO layer and Store API to access the eshop via Java. The API uses the simple DAO layer to perform CRUD operations on the database. Examples on how it works can be found on the projects wiki.
